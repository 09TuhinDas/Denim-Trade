# Archive Folder

This folder contains old or currently unused scripts, test files, and outputs that were manually generated or no longer needed in the automated pipeline.

Nothing here is deleted — just stored safely.

Contents:
- Manual test scripts (`test_fetch_*.py`)
- Individual stock backtest CSVs (moved for clarity)
- Redundant README.txt (already covered in README.md)
- `top_tickers.txt` — being replaced by dynamic CSV

All files here can be restored anytime.
